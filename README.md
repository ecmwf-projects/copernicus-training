# Training on data from the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) and Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS)

This repository hosts Jupyter notebook training material for the [Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S)](https://climate.copernicus.eu/) and the [Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS)](https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/). 

The training is designed for everyone who is interested in data from the two Copernicus services C3S and CAMS and has the following objectives:
* to provide an `overview of C3S and CAMS datasets`
* to showcase how data can be accessed via the [Climate Data Store (CDS)](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/home) and the [Atmosphere Data Store (ADS)](https://ads.atmosphere.copernicus.eu/#!/home), and
* to offer `example applications` and `analysis workflows` for different data types

## Course outline
The course is structured in two main parts and each part contains introduction and data overview notebooks as well as practical workflows.
