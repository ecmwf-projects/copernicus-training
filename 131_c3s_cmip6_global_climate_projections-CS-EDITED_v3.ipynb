    "This notebook provides a practical introduction on how to access and process [CMIP6 global climate projections](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/projections-cmip6?tab=overview) data available on the Climate Data Store (CDS) of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S). The workflow shows you how to compute and visualize the output of an ensemble of models for the annual global average temperature from 1850 to 2100. You will use the `historical` experiment for the temporal period 1850 to 2014 and the three scenarios `SSP1-2.6`, `SSP2-4.5` and `SSP5-8.5` for the period from 2015 to 2100. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of simiplicity, and to keep the volume of data small, the tutorial will make use of data from 8 models. However, many more models are available on the CDS, and when calculating an ensemble of models, the more that are used the more reliable the output. See [here](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/CMIP6%3A+Global+climate+projections#CMIP6:Globalclimateprojections-Models,gridsandpressurelevels) a full list of models included in the CDS-CMIP6 dataset.\n",

    "The visualization of the `CMIP6 annual global average temperature (1850 to 2100)` above shows that the global average temperature was more or less stable in the pre-industrial phase, but steadily increases since the 1990s. It further shows you that, depending on the SSP scenario, the course and increase of the global annual temperature differs fundamentally. While for the best case `SSP1-2.6` scenario, the global annual temperature could stabilize around 16 degC, for the worst case `SSP5-8.5` scenario, the global annual temperature could increase to above 20 degC."
